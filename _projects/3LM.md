Writing documentation for a codebase can be a challenging task. It not only requires a deep understanding of the codebase but also demands strong scientific writing skills, making it both time-consuming and expensive to create and maintain. Moreover, the process of onboarding new employees often requires significant time from senior engineers, who could otherwise focus on more pressing tasks.

3LM eliminates these struggles by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLM) to automatically generate comprehensive documentation in the form of Github Pages for any codebase. Once hosted on Github Pages, users can effortlessly utilize the built-in chat dialogues, powered by Github's in-house LLM, to ask questions about the documentation. 3LM simplifies complex codebases, transforming them into easy-to-read documentation that supports querying similar to ChatGPT. It's a game-changer for efficient knowledge transfer and resource management.

Below is a demonstration on how 3LM generates a comprehensive documentation for an example codebase:
