My implementation of Git used file persistence, cryptographic hashing (SHA-1), graph traversals, regex, and
data structures such as trees and queues. I designed this project with several core software engineering principles in mind, 
emphasizing efficiency, decomposition, and clean style.

Gitlet was my first project where I designed the entire project from the ground up. No boilerplate code, no design constraints.
I drafted my own design documentation, detailing the exact behaviors of every functions used in Git. I learnt to think ten
steps ahead while designing a particular data structure. Only 10% of the project involves coding, while 90% of the project
required a lot of thinking and design iterations until I make all the pieces fit together. Like writing a novel, I will have
to know exactly what I want to write, understand all the nuance interactions between characters in the plot, before I put
my pen on the page.
