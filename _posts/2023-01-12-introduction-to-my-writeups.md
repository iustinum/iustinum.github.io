description: writing for myself
---
Writing has always been hard for me. I enjoy reading and expressing my thoughts, and writing has always been my go-to method to express my ideas. The more I write, the more I realize that I tend to repeat myself. I would engage in a weird composition style inundated with abstract words and grammar. Initially I thought with more practice, I would get rid of this bad habit and write more coherent articles. But soon I found out that it is less of the mechanical act of writing, but more of my ability to think. *I simply cannot get my thoughts out in a linear fashion.* I realized that my inability to express myself clearly manifested into my awkward writing style. The more I thought about it the more I realized the gravity of my situation. If I can't write, I can't speak. If I can't speak, I cannot communicate well and thus may miss out on many things in life simply because I don't know how to advocate for myself/ask for help. My inability to communicate has such a large spillover effect that I decided to take action. In 2023, I finally mustered enough courage to start my own blog, with my best interests in mind to improving my writing skills.

With the advent of ChatGPT, one may ask, *what's the purpose of writing?* I argue that writing has become even more paramount in the era of generative AI. As repetitive tasks get automated away, individualism and creativity are the minimum requirements for contributing anything meaningful. Creativity is one thing that cannot be automated away. Even tools such as DALL-E and ChatGPT requires creative prompt writing skills - tasks that involve creative human input.

In this blog, I will write about anything that piques my interests. My sources of inspirations are my experiences, articles/books I read, and conversations I have with others. I will prioritize on structuring my thoughts in a succint manner rather than experimenting with ostentatious writing styles. My writing may not be the best, so any feedback is welcome. You can reach me through my email at the homepage. Welcome to my journey.
