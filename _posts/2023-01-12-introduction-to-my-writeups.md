description: Why is writing important?
---
I enjoy reading and vocalizing my thoughts, but I struggle with writing. The more I write, the more I realize that I tend to repeat myself. I write in a weird style filled with vague words and grammar. I thought I could improve writing if I simply write more, but soon I found out that writing is more about thinking and translating those thoughts into words. *I struggle with writing because I cannot get my thoughts out in a linear fashion, which is why I always repeat myself.* It's never too late to rethink how to improve my communication skills. This year, I finally mustered enough courage to start my own blog, with the sole purpose of improving my thinking and writing skills.

With the advent of ChatGPT, one may ask, *what's the purpose of writing?* I argue that writing has become even more paramount in the era of generative AI. As repetitive tasks get automated away, individualism and creativity are the minimum requirements for contributing anything unique. Creativity is one thing that cannot be automated away. Even tools such as DALL-E and ChatGPT requires prompt writing skills - tasks that involve creative human input.

I will write about anything that piques my interests. I take inspirations from personal experiences, digital contents, and interpersonal conversations. I will prioritize on structuring my thoughts in a succint manner rather than experimenting with ostentatious writing styles. I welcome any feedback. You can reach me through my email at the homepage. When I look back in a few years, I would hope to see some improvements.
