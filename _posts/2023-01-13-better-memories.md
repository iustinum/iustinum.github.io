I have always thought of memories as something innate. This [blog post](https://www.vox.com/even-better/23537229/improve-your-memory-concentration-tips)
offers some good tips to sharpen one's memory. Some techniques listed are:

<ul>
    <li>Avoid multitasking while remembering important things</li>
    <li>Assign vivid images to things you want to remember</li>
    <li>Allocate time to reflect on things you want to remember</li>
    <li>Become aware of forgetful moments</li>
</ul>

There are two categories of memories. The first category are memories that carry emotional significance such as when someone got their dream offer. Those memories are hard to forget and therefore would not benefit much from memory improvement techniques.

The second category are those that carry less emotional significance yet are important to remember. Examples include course
contents for exams. Making those subjects more memorable would benefit from those tips.

#### 1. Avoid Multitasking

Sometimes we forget important things simply because we did not pay attention while receiving them. We may be doing another
task or being distracted. The easiest way to prevent such losses of memories is to pay attention to those important things.

#### 2. Visual associations

I always remember things better when they are visually intriguing. A beautiful scenery or face, a pleasant experience --
those are all things that would last in my memories longer. If I want to remember where I left my car key, I would imagine the car
key as a decoration of a piece of furniture. In associating visual significance to a nondescript object, we artificially
increase its priority in our mental queue.

#### 3. Reflection

In elementary school, we are required to write a 800-word reflection if we violated school rule. The mechanical act of thinking about or writing
down something that we would not want to remember help us mentally encode those memories.

#### 4. Active Recollection

I learnt about this technique from statistics teacher in high school. On any given day, he would quiz us contents from the previous day's class. Here's how I apply this technique on other parts of my life:

1. I get exposed to the course material
2. I would intentionally shift my mind to other tasks.
3. When I am at the brink of forgetting those concepts, I will try to rewrite and summarize on what I had learnt without referencing the textbook.

It was helpful when I tried to understand solutions to algorithm questions since rewriting solutions allows me to see the heuristic of the
solution rather than the actual code itself.
