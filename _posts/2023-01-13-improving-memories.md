I have always thought of memories as something innate, but having read about improving memories from this blog post, I 
come to believe that memories can be improved through several visual techniques. Those techniques are:

<ul>
    <li>Avoid multitasking while remembering important things</li>
    <li>Assign vivid images to things you want to remember</li>
    <li>Allocate time to reflect on things you want to remember</li>
    <li>Become aware of forgetful moments</li>
</ul>

There are two types of memories. The first type are memories with significance. Those memories involve emotional events
in our lives such as weddings. Those are memories we can remember for life without paying much effort to it. The other type
of memories are those that carry less emotional significance but are important to remember. Examples of those memories include the names
of our classmates or the place where we put the car key. Those memories require repetitive and active reflections.

#### Avoid Multitasking

Sometimes we forget important things simply because we did not pay attention while receiving them. We may be doing another
task or being distracted. The easiest way to prevent such losses of memories is to pay attention to those important things.

#### Visual associations

I always remember things better when they are visually intriguing. A beautiful scenery or face, a pleasant experience --
those are all things that would last in my memories forever. While not everything in life are beautiful, we can artificially
assign importance to them by visual associations. If I want to remember where I left my car key, I would imagine the car
key as a decoration of a piece of furniture. In associating visual significance to a nondescript object, we artificially
increase its priority in our mental queue.

#### Reflection

Lastly, though mechanical, reflection is the most potent way to remember something. In elementary school, my teachers
would require us to write a two-page reflection if we violated school rule. The mechanical act of thinking about or writing
down something that we would not want to remember help us mentally encode those memories.

#### Active Recollection

I first heard about this technique from my high school statistics teacher. He would assign us quizzes at the beginning of
classes on contents from yesterday's class. He told us that, quizzes should not be treated us a means to evaluate academic
performance, but rather a learning tool to help us learn and draw mental connections with the subject matter. After the initial
exposure of learning something new, I would leave it and do some other tasks. After a while, I will come back to my desk and try
to rewrite and summarize on what I had learnt before, all without consulting the actual material. I found it an especially useful
technique to understand Leetcode solutions, as rewriting solutions without consulting allow me to savior the purpose of every
single line of code. Afterwards I would look through the entire solution as a whole to see the big picture on while this algorithm
works like that.
