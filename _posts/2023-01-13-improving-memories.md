I have always thought of memories as something innate. This [blog post](https://www.vox.com/even-better/23537229/improve-your-memory-concentration-tips)
offers some good tips to sharpen one's memory. Some techniques listed are:

<ul>
    <li>Avoid multitasking while remembering important things</li>
    <li>Assign vivid images to things you want to remember</li>
    <li>Allocate time to reflect on things you want to remember</li>
    <li>Become aware of forgetful moments</li>
</ul>

I would categorize memories into two types. The first type are memories carrying emotional significance such as the day
when one receives an offer to their dream college. Those memories are hard to forget and therefore are may be trivial to those
memory improvement techniques. 

The other type of memories are those that carry less emotional significance yet are important to remember. Examples include course
contents for exams. Making those subjects more memorable would benefit from those tips.

Those tips may seem obvious. I rewrite them out in my blog so that this post can serve as reminders when I forget to
practice them.

#### Avoid Multitasking

Sometimes we forget important things simply because we did not pay attention while receiving them. We may be doing another
task or being distracted. The easiest way to prevent such losses of memories is to pay attention to those important things.

#### Visual associations

I always remember things better when they are visually intriguing. A beautiful scenery or face, a pleasant experience --
those are all things that would last in my memories forever. While not everything in life are beautiful, we can artificially
assign importance to them by visual associations. If I want to remember where I left my car key, I would imagine the car
key as a decoration of a piece of furniture. In associating visual significance to a nondescript object, we artificially
increase its priority in our mental queue.

#### Reflection

Lastly, though mechanical, reflection is the most potent way to remember something. In elementary school, my teachers
would require us to write a two-page reflection if we violated school rule. The mechanical act of thinking about or writing
down something that we would not want to remember help us mentally encode those memories.

#### Active Recollection

I first heard about this technique from my high school statistics teacher. He would assign us quizzes at the beginning of
classes on contents from yesterday's class. He wanted to use quiz as a learning tool to consolidate our mental connections with course content. 
I applied this technique while trying to learn anything new. Following the initial exposure, I would shift my mind to other tasks. 
After I cooled off, I will try to rewrite and summarize on what I had learnt before without consulting any material. 
It was helpful when I tried to understand Leetcode solutions since rewriting solutions allows me to see the big picture of the
code rather than the functions of any single line of the code.
